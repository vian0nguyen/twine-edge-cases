When using any API (engine, dialog, UI, etc) be sure to tag them with `<<script>><</script>>`
Should look like this:
```
<<script>>
  UI.restart();
<</script>>
```
Its best practice for functionality like restarting and other API to nest these functions in a click or link like:

```
<<button>>
  <<script>>
   UI.restart();
  <</script>>
<</button>>
```
